# Bead close evidence

A bead close is a claim: *this work is done, and here is why you should believe
it.* The failure this exists to prevent is the close that makes the claim and
skips the reason — the one that says "verified against 23ai" with nothing to
point at, or cites a proof that is red, or mentions a defect that no bead tracks.

The shape of the claim is [`bead-close-evidence/v1`](EVIDENCE_CONTRACT.md); this
document is how it is produced and audited.

```bash
scripts/audit_bead_closes.py --template <bead-id>   # scaffold, prefilled from git
scripts/check_bead_close_evidence.sh                # read-only audit
scripts/check_bead_close_evidence.sh --strict       # also fail on unevidenced closes
```

Documents live at `tests/artifacts/evidence/closes/<bead-id>.json`. The filename
must match the document's `bead_id`; the audit checks it.

## The audit is read-only

It never writes a bead, never closes or reopens anything, never edits a file.
`--template` prints to stdout and nothing else. An auditor that can change what it
audits is not an auditor.

## Two tiers, kept apart on purpose

**Hard** — fails the audit. Every check is decidable:

| finding | meaning |
|---|---|
| any `E_*` from the contract | the document violates `bead-close-evidence/v1` |
| `MALFORMED_JSON` | it is not JSON |
| `BEAD_ID_MISMATCH` | the filename and the declared `bead_id` disagree |
| `SOURCE_SHA_ABSENT` | `source.sha` is not a commit in this repository |
| `PROOF_ARTIFACT_ABSENT` | a cited proof is not on disk |
| `LIVE_ARTIFACT_ABSENT` | a live claim points at a file that does not exist |

**Advisory** — reported, never gating. These are heuristics over free-text close
reasons, and they are kept out of the gate deliberately:

| finding | meaning |
|---|---|
| `CITED_SHA_UNRESOLVABLE` | the reason cites a hex string that does not resolve here |
| `LIVE_CLAIM_WITHOUT_REFERENCE` | the reason makes a live/e2e claim citing no commit or artifact |

`CITED_SHA_UNRESOLVABLE` **must not** be hard, and the reason is concrete: `etib.2`
legitimately cites `6cfd00aa642e`, an **upstream python-oracledb** commit that will
never resolve in this repository. Failing on it would flag a correct close. An
audit that cries wolf gets muted, and a muted audit is worse than no audit.

## Unevidenced closes are not failures

This repo has **337 closed beads** and the contract is new. Retroactively failing
every close that predates it would produce a permanently red gate, which teaches
people to ignore it. So the audit reports coverage as a number — currently 2 of
337 — and that number should only move one way. `--strict` opts into failing on
it, for a future where the backlog is worked down.

The 70 advisory `LIVE_CLAIM_WITHOUT_REFERENCE` hits are a real finding about this
repo's history, not noise to suppress: 70 closes claim live or end-to-end work
without citing a commit or artifact. That is the pattern the epic was opened for.
They are recorded rather than fixed, because rewriting other agents' historical
closes is not this bead's job.

## `tree_clean` means "in scope", for a close

**This is a deliberate reading of a shared field, and the mirror repo must use the
same one.**

`source.tree_clean` in a close document asserts that **every file this close
claims is committed at `source.sha`** — objectively checkable:

```bash
git status --porcelain -- <scope.in_scope paths>    # empty => tree_clean: true
```

It is **not** a claim that the entire working directory was pristine. This is a
multi-agent shared checkout: other panes routinely have unrelated files dirty, and
under a whole-tree reading *no agent could ever produce a valid close* — the gate
would be permanently red for everyone, for reasons having nothing to do with their
work.

The stricter whole-tree reading still applies where it earns its keep:
`required-proof/v1` and `mutation-result/v1` record commands that **actually
executed against the working tree**, so unrelated dirt genuinely can change what
they measured. A close document runs nothing; it is a set of references to a
commit, and a commit is by construction a clean tree.

This was found by dogfooding, not by a fixture: the first two close documents
written were the author's own, and the literal reading rejected one of them for
another agent's uncommitted file.

## Close evidence lands one commit after the work

A document names `source.sha` — the commit the work landed in — so it cannot be
inside that commit. The order is: land the work, then add its close evidence in
the following commit, then close the bead. The audit only requires that
`source.sha` exists and that the references resolve.

## Readiness: what a close may claim

`readiness` is a **pair**, and the pair is checked:

| basis | may claim `ready`? |
|---|---|
| `required-proof` | yes — the full Required graph ran at this SHA |
| `live-evidence` | yes — an exact-SHA live artifact exists |
| `scoped-test` | **no** → `E_SCOPED_TEST_CANNOT_MARK_READY` |
| `manual-review` | **no** → `E_INSUFFICIENT_READINESS_BASIS` |

A scoped test exercises the part of the change you were thinking about and says
nothing about the rest. Declaring `not-ready` on a scoped test is the honest way
to record complete-but-unproven work, and it is what the first two close documents
in this repo do — including this bead's own.

Note the consequence, which is intended: **until `f1cl.2` ships the
`required-proof/v1` producer, nothing here can honestly claim
`basis: required-proof`.** That is not a gap in the tooling; it is the tooling
telling the truth about what evidence exists.
