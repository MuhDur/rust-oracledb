"""Read-only audit of bead close evidence.

READ-ONLY, and that is a design constraint, not a disclaimer: this command never
writes a bead, never closes or reopens anything, and never touches a file. An
auditor that can change the thing it audits is not an auditor. `--template` is
the one exception and it only prints to stdout.

What it audits
--------------
Closes that carry a bead-close-evidence/v1 document under
tests/artifacts/evidence/closes/<bead-id>.json get the full check: the document
must satisfy the contract, its proof references must exist on disk, and every
SHA it cites must be a real commit in this repository.

Closes that carry no document are reported as UNEVIDENCED. They are not failures.
This repo has hundreds of closes that predate the contract, and retroactively
failing them would only teach people to ignore the audit. Coverage is reported as
a number so it can move in one direction.

Two tiers, kept apart on purpose
--------------------------------
  hard      Structural, exit non-zero. Every check is decidable: a document
            either satisfies the schema or does not; a SHA either resolves or
            does not.
  advisory  Heuristics over free-text close reasons, reported and never gating.
            Text scanning cannot be made reliable -- see the note on upstream
            SHAs in _scan_reason -- and an audit that cries wolf gets muted,
            which is worse than one that stays quiet.
