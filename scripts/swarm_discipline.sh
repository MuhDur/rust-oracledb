# Swarm discipline mechanisms — AGENTS.md constitution rules 13-18.
#
# Five agents share one checkout. Each subcommand here answers, from git or from
# an exit status, a question that a 2026-07-21 incident showed an agent answering
# from a buffer, a guess, or a hope:
#
#   foreign-edit       rule 13  is this file broken, or is another agent mid-edit?
#   evidence-source    rule 14  what is the honest source block for this evidence?
#   verified-push      rule 15  did the gate actually pass?
#   bounded-run        rule 16  how long may this turn block?
#   unbounded-wait-lint rule 16 do committed scripts contain a wait that cannot end?
#   struct-atomicity   rule 17  does this change add a field without its initializers?
#   stale-delete-check rule 18  is this commit deleting files that still exist?
#
# Exit codes: 0 satisfied · 64 usage/environment · 65 refused (rule violated)
# · 124 bounded-run deadline reached.

foreign-edit (rule 13)
  Reports, per path, whether the worktree copy differs from HEAD. A differing
  path is another agent mid-edit until proven otherwise: judge it at HEAD
  (git show HEAD:PATH) before calling it a defect. Exit 65 if any path differs.

evidence-source (rule 14)
  Prints the evidence "source" object {sha, tree_clean, branch} derived from git
  instead of asserted by hand. --kind close scopes tree_clean to the bead's
  in-scope paths (what the close auditor checks) and reports other agents' dirty
  paths as a note; --kind proof requires the whole tree to be clean, because a
  reproducibility proof describes code at a commit. Refuses rather than emit
  tree_clean:false.

verified-push (rule 15)
  Runs the named gate, records its verdict, and pushes only on exit 0. HEAD must
  not move while the gate runs. A failed gate never reaches git push.

bounded-run / unbounded-wait-lint (rule 16)
  bounded-run imposes a hard deadline and reports a timeout as a result.
  unbounded-wait-lint refuses committed shell that waits without a deadline.

struct-atomicity (rule 17)
  For each struct field a change adds, lists struct-literal and struct-pattern
  sites the same change does not touch and that do not use `..`. Those sites
  stop compiling the moment the field lands, so they belong in this commit.

stale-delete-check (rule 18)
  Refuses a change that deletes a path still present in the worktree. Such a
  deletion is a stale index snapshot committed over another agent's landed
  work, not a delete anyone asked for.
