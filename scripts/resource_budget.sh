# Why this exists
# ---------------
# Three incidents, one shape: a heavy run helps itself to the whole box.
#
#   ~40GB RSS global OOM.
#   cargo-mutants fanned out to ~9,700 threads and exhausted the cgroup's 512-task
#   limit, so even fork() failed; a "safe" 4-shard rerun re-created the lockout.
#   2026-07-16: eight concurrent --workspace builds filled the 124G tmpfs behind
#   CARGO_TARGET_DIR and wedged the machine for every agent.
#
# The retrospective's finding, which this encodes: **a memory cap alone was not
# enough** — the PID/task budget was the scarce resource. So every budget here
# declares memory AND tasks AND an isolated target dir, and the kernel enforces
# all three.
#
# Mechanism: systemd-run --user --scope, i.e. a real cgroup v2 scope per run.
#
# NOT ulimit -u. RLIMIT_NPROC is per-UID, not per-process-tree. Every agent in
# this swarm runs as the same user, so `ulimit -u 256` would cap against the
# other agents' processes too: your build would fail to fork because someone
# else's test suite was busy. It is also one-way (a lowered limit cannot be
# raised back). A cgroup scope binds this run's subtree and nothing else.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Task budgets are MEASURED, not guessed. The first version of this file guessed
# 512/256 and was wrong in the dangerous direction: it strangled legitimate work.
# A scoped `cargo mutants` run died on its BASELINE build with
#   failed to spawn thread: Os { code: 11, kind: WouldBlock }
# because a single-crate build needs far more tasks than it looks like it should.
#
# Measured on this host (128 cores, cargo jobs=4), by reading the run's own
# cgroup pids.peak/memory.peak:
#
#   cargo build -p oracledb-protocol --tests   peak_tasks =  602   mem ~0.95 GiB
#   cargo mutants -j1, one file, cold deps     peak_tasks = 5850   mem ~1.6  GiB
#
# 5850 tasks to mutate ONE 91-line file is not intuitive, and it is why guessing
# does not work here: `jobs=4` bounds concurrent rustc PROCESSES, but each rustc
# sizes its own thread pool from the machine's CORE COUNT (128 here). Task usage
# therefore scales with cores and with cache coldness -- a cold dep tree costs
# ~10x a warm scoped build -- not with the jobs flag.
#
# A budget has to sit between two numbers:
#   above  ~5850  or it breaks legitimate work. It did: the first version of this
#                 file guessed 256 and 512 and killed a real mutation run on its
#                 baseline build ("failed to spawn thread: WouldBlock").
#   below  the runaway. The retrospective's cargo-mutants incident reached ~9,700
#                 threads and exhausted a 512-task limit until fork() failed.
#
# That window is narrower than it looks, so these are floors from measurement
# plus headroom, not round numbers someone liked. RE-MEASURE rather than raise on
# a hunch: run under a generous cap, read pids.peak from the run's cgroup, put
# the number here. Callers with evidence can override per-run with --tasks and
# --memory rather than editing this table.
#
# These numbers are HOST-SPECIFIC (128 cores). On a smaller machine they are
# loose; on a bigger one they may be tight.
