# "a heavy run cannot exceed the declared task/PID budget (proven by a
# bounded-fanout test)", so this actually tries to exceed it and asserts the

#
# Every experiment here is bounded and runs inside the very cgroup under test: a
# fanout that escaped its budget would be the bug, and the test is what proves it
# does not. Nothing here touches /tmp/cargo-target or any shared state.

# Deliberately try to exceed the budget from inside it, against a tiny TasksMax
# so refusal is forced. Two things make this test honest:
#
#   Report with BUILTINS ONLY. Past the cap there is no fork left, so $(cat) or
#   an external `echo` would hang -- that IS the incident ("even fork() failed").
#   `read`/`echo` are bash builtins and keep working.
#
#   Do not count via `if cmd &`. Backgrounding always returns 0 and bash retries
#   a failed fork internally, so a `&`-based counter reports success even while
#   the kernel is refusing. Ask the KERNEL instead:
#     pids.peak       - the high-water mark; must never exceed the budget
#     pids.events max - how many forks the kernel denied; must be > 0 here
#
#   Overshoot the cap MODERATELY (cap + 8). Overshooting hard is self-defeating:
#   at ~4x the cap the reporting shell is killed by the very denial it is
#   measuring -- a SIGCHLD interrupts a retrying fork and bash aborts with
#   "fork: Interrupted system call" before it can print anything. cap+8 reliably
#   reaches the cap and triggers denials while leaving the reporter alive.
#   Retry a few times. The reporting shell lives inside the cgroup it is
#   measuring, so under heavy load (another agent mid-build) it can still lose a
#   race and print nothing. Observed once, on a busy box. A gate that goes red
#   because the machine was busy gets muted, so distinguish "no answer, ask
#   again" from "the wrong answer", and only the second one fails.
