# Bead close-evidence audit (bead f1cl.5).
#
# READ-ONLY. Never writes a bead, never closes or reopens anything, never edits
# a file. An auditor that can change what it audits is not an auditor.
#
# Fails only on HARD findings: a close-evidence document that violates
# bead-close-evidence/v1, names a SHA that is not a commit here, or points at a
# proof/artifact that is not on disk. Free-text heuristics over close reasons are
# reported as advisory and never gate — see docs/BEAD_CLOSE_EVIDENCE.md for why.
# The closed-bead population comes from the committed .beads/issues.jsonl export,
# not a runner-local br installation, so the same audit is reproducible in CI.
#
# Pass --strict to also fail when any closed bead carries no evidence. Not the
# default: this repo has hundreds of closes that predate the contract, and
# failing them retroactively would only teach people to ignore the audit.
