# Bead close-evidence audit (bead f1cl.5).
#
# READ-ONLY. Never writes a bead, never closes or reopens anything, never edits
# a file. An auditor that can change what it audits is not an auditor.
#
# Fails on deterministic HARD findings, including post-charter landed-source,
# clean-scope, Bead-trailer, scheduled-live-run, and false-close controls.
#
# Pass --strict to also fail when any closed bead carries no evidence. Not the
# default: this repo has hundreds of closes that predate the contract, and
# failing them retroactively would only teach people to ignore the audit.
