# cross-repo-evidence-contract-v1 gate (bead f1cl.1).
#
# Validates every fixture under schemas/evidence/fixtures against the four
# evidence schemas, offline and with no database, network or third-party
# package. Valid fixtures must be accepted; each invalid fixture must be
# rejected for the exact rule it declares in the manifest, and for nothing else.
#
# The point of the negative half is that a rule which silently stops firing
# still looks green. Asserting "rejected, with this code, at this path" is what
# makes a dead rule fail loudly.
#
# The schemas themselves are mirrored byte-for-byte with the sibling oraclemcp
# repo; see docs/EVIDENCE_CONTRACT.md.
